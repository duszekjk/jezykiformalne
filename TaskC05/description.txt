Your program should read a finite-state automaton from file in the first argument.
The automaton is deterministic, you can assume it does not contain
cycles.

Each automaton path is labeled with a symbol sequence of the following form:

<input word>;<description>

e.g.:

biały;ADJ
dom;N
piła;N
piła;V
stali;N
stali;V
stali;ADJ

Next you should read words from the standard input.
For each word, you should all automaton
paths that begin a given word, the following symbol is ';'
(semicolon), e.g. for the word 'dom' we are looking for paths
beginning with 'dom;'. If there is no such path, the following message
should be printed:

<input word>;OOV

For instance, for the automaton given above and the input:

budynek
dom
piła

we should get:

budynek;OOV
dom;N
piła;N
piła;V

If there is more than one path for a given word, they should be given in alphabetical order.

The program does not have to check whether the automaton is correct
and whether it is deterministic and does not contain cycles.
