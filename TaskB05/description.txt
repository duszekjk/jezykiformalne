Use a deterministic finite-state automaton (FSA) engine from the TaskB00.
Create your own FSA description to check whether the line contains string '19DD', where D is a digit.
Save it to fsa_description.arg file.

FSA alphabet is '0123456789x'.

Read strings from the standard input.
If a string is accepted by the
automaton, write YES, otherwise- write NO.
