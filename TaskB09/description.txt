Use a deterministic finite-state automaton (FSA) engine from the previous task.
Create your own FSA description to check whether the word "macbeth" is in the given line.
Save it to fsa_description.arg file.

FSA alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz '.

Read strings from the standard input.
If a string is accepted by the
automaton, write YES, otherwise- write NO.
