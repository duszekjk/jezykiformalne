Read a description of a deterministic finite-state automaton in the AT&T format
(without weights) from the file in the first argument.

Read strings from the standard input.
If a string is accepted by the
automaton, write YES, otherwise- write NO.

The program is invoked like this: ./run.py fsa_description.arg < test1.in > test1.out
