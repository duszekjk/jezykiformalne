Paths
======

Your program should read a finite-state automaton from
the standard input.
The automaton is deterministic, you can assume it does not contain
cycles. The automaton alphabet is the set of Polish lower-case letters
(English letters plus: ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź and ż).

Your program should print, on standard output, all the paths of the
automaton in alphabetical order (to be precise: order induced by byte
codes of strings, not according to the standard Polish order). "Print
a path" means print a text line containing all subsequent characters.

The program does not have to check whether the automaton is correct
and whether it is deterministic and does not contain cycles.

Weights (if any) should be disregarded.

NOTE 1. You can add `LANG=C sort` to your Bash wrapper for the write sort.
