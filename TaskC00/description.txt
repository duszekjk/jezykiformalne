Read a description of a non-deterministic finite-state automaton in the AT&T format                                                                                                                                                                         
(without weights) from the file in the first argument.

Read strings from the standard input.
If a string is accepted by the
automaton, write YES, otherwise- write NO.

The program is invoked like this: python run.py test1.arg test1.in test1.out

Note that not all transitions must be included in description.
If no transition is given for the given state and letter, write NO.
