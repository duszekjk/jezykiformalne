Use a non deterministic finite-state automaton (FSA) engine from the TaskC00.
Create your own non deterministic FSA description to check whether the string
contains "abc"
Don't use external files like in TaskF00 (description should be included in run file).

The alphabet is "a", "b", "c"

Read strings from the standard input.
If a string is accepted by the 
automaton, write YES, otherwise- write NO.
