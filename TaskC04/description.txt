Deterministic automaton III
===========================

Read a description of a finite-state automaton in the AT&T format
(without weights) from the file in the first argument. Then, read strings from the
standard input. If a string is
accepted by the automated, write YES, a space and the string on the
standard output, otherwise â€” write NO, a space and the string.

If there is a non-determinism in the automaton, the first transition should be chosen.

The automaton can contain epsilon transitions ("<eps>" instead of a
character). They should be interpreted as follows: an epsilon
transition can be used (without "eating" a character from the input),
if there is no other transition applicable. You can assume that there
is at most one epsilon transition from a given state and that there
are no cycles with epsilon transition.

Your program does not have to check whether the description is correct
and whether the automaton is deterministic. You can assume that the
automaton does not contain epsilon transitions.
