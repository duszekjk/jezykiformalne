Use a deterministic finite-state automaton (FSA) engine from the TaskE00.
Create your own FSA description to check whether the string contains "0"
even number of times.
Save it to fsa_description.arg file.

The alphabet is "0", "1".

Read strings from the standard input.
If a string is accepted by the
automaton, write YES, otherwise- write NO.
